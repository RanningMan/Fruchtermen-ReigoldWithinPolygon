This is the readme file for program that implements F-R algorithm in polygon

1.first copy all the codes into a java environment machine
2.	the paremeters: graph file, polygon coordinates, temperature and iteration times, can be changed in Windows.java
3.	you may also need to change parameter C, cooling function, the way that initialize the graph position before visualization to fit the new requirement, all of these can be found in FRPolygonLayout.java
4.run the program
5.click "run" button to run algorithm without polygon, click "runPolygon" to run algorithm within polygon

Learn more about the algorithm, see ProgramExplain file or search papers about F-R algorithm
